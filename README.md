# RVV-cycle-accurate-simulator

This is a cycle-accurate simulator that models the vector processing unit in a RISC-V hart. It will keep track of the CSRs, data in the vector registers and etc.

The goal of this project is to learn more about RISC-V's Vector extension. I am using the wiki to document the extension in a (hopefully) clearer way than the ISA standard.
